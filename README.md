# Personal Dashboard

## About

This dashboard will serve two main purposes.

One is for organization. All of my resource will be available in one place for me to search and filter through.
This includes email, various note taking tools such as Logseq, and project management tools such as Trello and GitHub, among other resources that I use periodically.

The other purpose is to collect and analyze data; both to help me become more productive and to help stay on top of my diabetes.

<!-- ### Notable Features

## Aspirations

<!-- TODO: After I am more organized and/or before the Deploy Minimum Viable Product of Website milestone is completed , come back to this section to add notable features. -->

<!-- TODO: Link to the Blood Glucose Beacon app and Data Logging app repos. Even better, the live sites. -->

Once I get the beta version deployed I'll shift my focus to creating my Blood Glucose Beacon app, an app for notifying people in my contacts list that my blood glucose is dangerously low with my coordinates. As well as my Data Logging app, an app that allows me to enter discrete information into a database. Information such as the last time I changed the sensor site and which arm it is located on.

I'll make API calls against these two using this dashboard to contribute to the health data that I'll be analyzing.

<!-- To assist with my health, it will pull data in from a few apps that I use to manage my diabetes. Such as NightScout, my [Data Logging App](https://github.com/JamieBort/Data-Logging-App), Strava, a sleep app, and WGER a weightlifting app. -->

## Technology Used

This site is built using Svelt TypeScript on the front end and Java on the back end. Which database I'll use is yet to be seen.

Any data that is private in nature will be behind authentication.
