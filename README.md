<!-- TODO: Create an Issue to make this section look more attractive aesthetically. -->

A website for displaying and searching daily data; such as blood glucose numbers and upcoming events.

It will be used to help manage my diabetes better and my time better.

To assist with my health, it will pull data in from a few apps that I use to manage my diabetes. Such as NightScout, my [Data Logging App](https://github.com/JamieBort/Data-Logging-App), Strava, a sleep app, and WGER a weightlifting app.

To assist with organization it will pull data from Google Calendar, Trello, and GitHub.

To assist with my professional progress, it will pul data in from LinkedIn, Pocket, and Logseq.

Once I get the beta version deployed I'll shift my focus to creating my Blood Glucose Beacon app, an app for notifying people in my contacts list that my blood glucose is dangerously low with my coordinates. As well as my Data Logging app, an app that allows me to enter discrete information into a database. Such as <!-- TODO: find examples to add here. -->.

## Technology Used

This site is built using Svelt TypeScript on the front end and Java on the back end. Which database I'll use is yet to be seen.

Any data that is private in nature will be behind authentication.
