<!-- ./administrative/trello_cards_to_comb_through/list_of_trello_cards.md -->

The below links are from the Trello cards that I combed through as a result of [Issue 21](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/21).

NOTE: I added this `Added to the ./administrative/trello_cards_to_comb_through/list_of_trello_cards.md file.` string to most of the Trello cards found below so that I could search for them easily in Trello if I needed to find them again.

NOTE: Per [Issue 21](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/21)

I used the Trello [api -"Linked to Personal Dashboard APIs in Digital Knowledge Base" -"repurpose"](https://trello.com/search?q=api%20-%22Linked%20to%20Personal%20Dashboard%20APIs%20in%20Digital%20Knowledge%20Base%22%20-%22repurpose%22) query

to search for Trello cards that

had `api` but didn't have `repurpose` nor `Linked to Personal Dashboard APIs in Digital Knowledge Base`.

# List of Trello Cards

The list of Trello cards relating to this Personal Dashboard repo.

Collected here to address the [Comb through the Trello cards.](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/21) #21 GitHub Issue.

**NOTE:** for now I am **NOT** listing any trello card with `API` in the title. Because that is obvious.
