# project_resources

Created for [Issue #14](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/14).

This directory houses all of the resources I'll need to refer back to as I build out this project.

Per[Issue #14](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/14), these resources will be moved to other locations.

This project_resources/ directory will be deleted when

- the `fullstack` branch is deleted

- and/or when the [Prepare repo administratively to start building out the font and back ends](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/milestone/3) milestone is closed.
