This project_resources/ directory will be deleted when

- the `fullstack` branch is deleted

- and/or when the [Prepare repo administratively to start building out the font and back ends](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/milestone/3) milestone is closed.

#### [tempFiles/](./tempFiles/)

Contains files and directories from

- other branches,

- directories from the root directory in this `fullstack` branch.

Created for [Issue #23](https://github.com/JamieBort/Personal-Dashboard/issues/23).
