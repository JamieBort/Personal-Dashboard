# attempt04

**NOTE:** this didn't work for me either.
I am going to table this `attempt03` directory and this `react_js` branch for now.
And I will next attempt to make an call to the back end directly - assume the issues I am running into will not occur if I make a call to the back end directly...
If that fails, I will work on a course that will walk me through the process of making a fetch using JavaScript and possibly a library and/or framework.

Currently in the `java_setup` branch.
