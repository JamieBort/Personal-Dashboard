# Progress

`front_end_attempt01` branch.

This branch is for setting up a front end.

It remains to be seen whether it will be built with React.js, React native, or both (possibly using bit.dev).

## Next Steps

* Start building the front end.
    
    With the intention of making api calls first.

    To that end, 
    
        Build a React.js front end using this https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeTheDream/tree/main/BaldEagleReactFrontEndClass/lesson-1-8 course as a framework to start from. 
        (Use these https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-bald-eagle/wiki/Lesson-1.1 instructions.)
        When the time is right, us this https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/API/REST/TrelloAPICalls to make make the first API calls. 

    ~~To that end, review how I made api calls in the past.~~ Done.
    
    Start with https://trello.com/c/NFRSx1Q6/171-api-professional-development the Trello card.

    Maybe use "Road to React".

    Maybe use the React course from CtD.

    And https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/API/REST
    
    ~~Maybe use this https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Libraries/React/contacts-manager~~ Not sufficient. Simply makes api calls - doesn't load with a button for example.

* Assess whether my choice of using React.js, React native, or both (possibly using bit.dev) was a good decision.
    
    And whether I need to change my decision and build the front end with one of the other two options.

## Status

* I am leaning towards using React.js

    And then reevaluating whether it will work correctly for my needs.

    >Determine whether to build using React.js, React native, or both (possibly using bit.dev).
    
    >This dashboard will be used both on my android phone and via my laptop.

    >To that end, read the articles found in the `Research.md` file.

* Not yet started.
