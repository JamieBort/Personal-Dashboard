# Progress

## Status
### Currently
* Run locally
    * Currently in the `react_js` branch.
    * Navigate to `file:///Users/jamiebort/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/frontend/attempt04/index.html` in the browser.
    * Open up `./personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/` in vs code.
    * Run `./personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/backend/src/main/java/personal_dashboard/backend/BackendApplication.java` in vs code.
    * Then in the browser, navigate to `file:///Users/jamiebort/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/PersonalDashboard/frontend/attempt04/index.html`
    * and select the `Fetch` button to log to the console a call to `http://localhost:8085/topics`.

* **branches** structure:    

        +-- master/main
            +-- dev
                +-- React.js branch with Java back end and database. (react_js)
                    +-- "host" branch (called host) for figuring out how to deploy and host both the front and back ends on a service such as heroku
                +-- React Native branch with Java back end and database. (react_native) (doesn't exist yet)

* **directories** structure:

        +-- root directory (PersonalDashboard/)
            +-- front end directory (frontend/)
            +-- back end directory (backend/)

### Completed
* Cleaning up the root directory in the master branch
    [Clean up the root directory in the master branch](https://trello.com/c/eoj2x4Zs/1117-clean-up-the-root-directory-in-the-master-branch) Trello card.
* Removing old branches.
* revamping the readme.md file.
* revamping the master Trello card

## Next Steps
1.
    ~~Clean up repo~~ so that

    a.
        ~~[Remove old branches](https://trello.com/c/5LzmS26g/1116-clean-up-github-repo-branches-for-personal-dashboard-repo)~~. Done

    b.
        the **branches** are structured such that:
        
        +-- master/main
            +-- dev
                +-- React.js branch with Java back end and database. (react_js)
                +-- React Native branch with Java back end and database. (react_native)

    The front end on each branch will look identical or similar.

    The functionality that it needs is to navigate between pages.
    
    And display info appropriate to that page.

    c.
        the **directories** are structured such that:
        
        +-- root directory (PersonalDashboard/)
            +-- front end directory (frontend/)
            +-- back end directory (backend/)

2.
    ~~Then set up the back end~~. Done
    
    Deleted both
    * the `java_setup` (local) branch and
    * the `remotes/origin/java_setup` remote branch.

3.
    Then set up the frontend. Something basic just to make sure
    * it's working as I want and need.
    * and to decide which to use
        * React.js
        * or React Native.
        
        The front end on each branch will look identical or similar.

        The functionality that it needs is to navigate between pages.
    
        And display info appropriate to that page.

4.
    Deploy both on platform such as Heroku so that I can use React.js and React Native on my phone. To make a decision about which to use.

5.
    Then work on getting it behind a password/some sort of security.

6.
    Then bring in the database(s).
