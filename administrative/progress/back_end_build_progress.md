# Progress

`back_end_build` branch

**Build the back end.**

## Status

* I started with following this tutorial:

    "ReactJS + Spring Boot CRUD Full Stack App - 3 - Create Spring Boot Project and Configure MySQL"

    Details found in the `Resources` section below.

    >Build a few using some throw away repos.

* I am leaning towards starting with Java. Because then I can demonstrate my Java skills. Whereas if I work with Node.js, I am using JavaScript for the front **AND** back end.

    >Research both Java and Node.js.

    >Compile the tutorials and similar resources I've already used. And find some online. Put them in the "Resources" section below.

    >Also, search online for articles to help answer these questions.

    >Which is best for my purposes?

    >Which is can I implement more easily?

    >Etc.

*   Started filling out the `Next Steps` section below.

    See `Next Steps` section below.

## Next Steps

2. If "ReactJS + Spring Boot CRUD Full Stack App - 3 - Create Spring Boot Project and Configure MySQL" doesn't work out (see status above),

    attempt to use "Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17" Udemy course.

    See the `Resources` section below for details.

3. Choose one.

~~1. Determine whether to use Java or Node.js for the back end.~~

~~2. Start building the back end.~~ For another branch.

## Options

My options are to choose 

    a. Java

    b. Node.js

    c. Start with one and then try the other.
