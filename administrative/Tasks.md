# Tasks

To-Do items that need to be addressed.

## Administrative

The follow folder structure is needed:

```
./administrative/
./backend/
./frontend/
./.gitignore
[license]
./README.md
```

### Administrative To Do

- Add a license for the repo.

- Clean up these directories. Specifically,

  - They need to be whittled down to just

    - ./administrative/,

    - ./backend/,

    - and ./frontend/

  - To that end

    - go through each directory to see what needs to be salvaged,

    - salvage it,

    - then remove that directory.

  - ./.vscode needs to be removed from the repo.

- Clean up these files. Specifically,

  - The ./.gitignore file needs to be cleaned up.

  - ./Progress.md needs to be absorbed into the ./administrative/ directory.

  - The ./README.md file needs to be cleaned up.

    - Including add a `Last Updated Tag`.

- Clean up the branches. Remove the ones that are not necessary.

  - To that end go through each branch to see what needs to be salvaged.

### Administrative Status

### Administrative Next Steps

- Add a license for the repo.

- Do these 6 things together and in sequence:

  - Start with the furthest (newest (?)) branch. (figure out which branch is the most recent.)

  - Then look at each directory.

  - Then look at each file.

  - Lastly, determine what should be kept from each file.

  - Move it into this branch.

  - Systematically remove

    - the file,

    - then the directory,

    - then the branch.

## Full Stack

### Full Stack To Do

When the Administrative tasks above have been completed, it will be time to build out the frame of the app.

To that end, obtain a NextJS TypeScript starter app from Vercel. Deploy it.

Then do the same with Java and Heroku. (or koyeb: https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Hosting and https://www.koyeb.com/blog/sustaining-free-compute-in-a-hostile-environment)

Lastly, build the back end and the front end.
